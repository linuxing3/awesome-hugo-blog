* Integrations
Hugo has .org file support natively, which is what I'll be using. There are other options out there, ox-hugo being the big one. This will let you write in org and then export into a .md file that hugo understands and gives you more control of the output. Check that out if you have additional needs that are required.

* Front matter
While Hugo has front matter, you can easily translate that into org-mode document properties. For example, this is what is on the top of this file:

#+begin_src org
  #+title: Using Org Mode in Hugo
  #+subtitle: emacs everywhere
  #+date: 2019-08-02
  #+tags[]: howto, emacs, hugo
#+end_src org

Which maps pretty directly to the toml front matter.
