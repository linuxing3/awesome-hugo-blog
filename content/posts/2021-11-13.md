To go to a new webpage, press o, then type a url, then press Enter (Use O to open the url in a new tab, go to edit the current URL)

If what you’ve typed isn’t a url, then a search engine will be used instead (DuckDuckGo, by default)

To switch between tabs, use J (next tab) and K (previous tab), or press <Alt-num>, where num is the position of the tab to switch to

To close the current tab, press d (and press u to undo closing a tab)

Use H and L to go back and forth in the history

To click on something without using the mouse, press f to show the hints, then type the keys next to what you want to click on (if that sounds weird, then just try pressing f and see what happens)

Press : to show the commandline

To search in a page, press /, type the phrase to search for, then press Enter. Use n and N to go back and forth through the matches, and press Esc to stop doing the search.

To close qutebrowser, press Alt-F4, or :q, or :wq to save the currently open tabs and quit (note that in the settings you can make qutebrowser always save the currently open tabs)
